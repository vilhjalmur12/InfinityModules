# Install PizzeriaUno

## Prerequisites
You need to have NodeJS installed in order to use this. A server where you can retrieve the data from API is located in a server folder in root.

## Getting started

Open your terminal and make sure you are located at the root folder of the project.

###
Starting the API server

First navigate to the server folder by typing to the terminal.

```
cd server

```

Run in the terminal following to install all dependencies for the server.

```
npm install

```

When all dependencies have been installed run the server with:

```
npm start

```

The server is now listening on port 3500. Navigate back to the root folder with.

```
cd ..

```

###
Starting the app server

Make sure you are located at the root directory of the project.

To install all modules needed to run the app we need to run in terminal

```
npm install

```

Once all modules have been added we can start the server as following

```
npm start

```

When you have run npm start, the browser opens up on localhost:9000 and every time you change your code within the /src folder the browser refreshes and shows the latest updates. While server is still running you can always visit the localhost:9000 on your browser.
